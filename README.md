# DumpEm Suite 2

DumpEm Suite v2.0.0 is the second iteration (or third if you count DumpEm) of the DumpEm Suite investment tool. Albeit being very useful for note-taking, the prior
version of DumpEm Suite suffers from poor code as well as design choices mixed with an inflexible UI and some minor bugs. For this reason, I've decided to re-design
and re-write the investment suite. DumpEm Suite 2 is set to feature a customizable and flexible UI coupled with new modules and tools to help with information gathering
and visualization. 

Below are the auto-generated Vite-Electron-React instructions for installation.
